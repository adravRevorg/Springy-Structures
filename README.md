# Springy Structures

Modeled 3D springy structures, using the concepts of mass-spring-damper systems.

1. 2D spring
2. Butterfly [2 planes, connected with torsional spring]
3. Jello Cube
4. Jello Cube, with edge-edge collision
5. Springy Paraboloid

Also, in case 3, there is implementation for both euler integration, and Range-Kutta4 integration. There is option to real-time toggle between the two types of integration to show the contrasting situation [ euler system explodes, whereas RK4 is relatively stable. And switching to RK4, stabilises the otherwise unstable euler integration].
